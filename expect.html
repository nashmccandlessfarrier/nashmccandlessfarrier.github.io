		<h2> Things to Know: </h2>
		
		<ul>
		
			<li><p> Quality is one of our number one goals and while we are quite efficient we take 0 shortcuts. </p></li>
			
			<li><p> A scheduled appointment is important for us to make sure we keep organized and prepared for future appointments. Rescheduling can be easily accomplished if you have a show or event that keeps you from being able to hold your horse for us. </p></li>
			
			<li><p> Our vehicle is a van that is on the larger side so an area for us to turn around and park up is important. </p></li>
			
			<li><p> Dangerous horses are something we do not tolerate as they could put us or themselves in serious risk of life threatening injury. Please make sure your horse is well behaved and able to stand well. </p></li>
			
			<li><p> Having your horse or horses caught before the appointment would be best since we can get right into our work and have your horse all fixed up. </p></li>
			
			<li><p> Payment at time of service is all we ask. Cash, checks, and PayPal accepted. </p></li>
			
			<li><p> The weekends are for emergencies so call if you lose a shoe or need a checkup before a show. </p></li>
