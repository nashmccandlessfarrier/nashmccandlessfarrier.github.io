		<h2> Quality </h2>
		<img class="equip" src="images/shoe.jpg" alt="hot fitting" >
		<p> We are committed to the highest quality standard there is. This means that we take no shortcuts in our work. If we have to pull off a shoe to alter it because the nail didn't drive quite right then we will do so without hesitation. When we finish your horse we make sure it is completely correct and done with no errors. Part of our commitment to quality includes fitting the shoe perfectly by hot fitting and making sure it fits perfectly. Think of your own foot, you wouldn't wear a shoe that doesn't fit properly right? It goes the same way for your horses, and we take great pride in our ability to fit shoes just right.</p>

		<h2> Horsemanship </h2>
		<img class="equip" src="images/training.jpeg" alt="training" >
		<p> Not only do we keep up our quality, we keep up our horsemanship as well. Through a decade of training horses and much experience, we've learned a few things about demeanor. Staying quiet and gentle around these animals so we can make sure that not only we are safe but your horse as well.</p>

		<h2> Scheduling/Education </h2>
		<img class="equip" src="images/shutter.jpg" alt="nailing" >
		<p> Through experience and education we've learned that a 4-6 week schedule for hoof care is ideal. We are committed to making sure your horses are put on a good schedule for them, but your convenience and time is also important to us so to better serve we always make sure to schedule the next appointment based upon your availability.</p>
